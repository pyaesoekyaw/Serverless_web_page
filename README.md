## üåü **Project Overview**  
This project implements a **fully serverless data management system** that allows users to securely submit and retrieve data through a web interface. Designed for scalability and cost-efficiency, it leverages AWS serverless technologies to eliminate infrastructure management overhead while ensuring high availability and automatic scaling under variable workloads.  

---

## ‚ú® **Key Features**  
- **Secure Data Transmission**: All communications are encrypted via HTTPS using CloudFront  
- **Serverless Backend**: Lambda functions handle data processing with zero server management  
- **Scalable Storage**: DynamoDB provides single-digit millisecond latency at any scale  
- **CDN Accelerated**: Global content delivery via CloudFront edge locations  
- **CORS Enabled**: Pre-configured for cross-origin access from web applications

## ‚öôÔ∏è **AWS Services Used**  
| Service | Purpose | Configuration Notes |  
|---------|---------|---------------------|  
| **Amazon S3** | Hosts static website files | Versioning disabled, public access blocked |  
| **AWS Lambda** | Processes GET/POST requests | Python 3.9, 128MB memory |  
| **API Gateway** | REST API endpoint management | Edge-optimized, CORS enabled |  
| **DynamoDB** | NoSQL database for user data | On-demand capacity mode |  
| **CloudFront** | Secure content delivery | HTTPS enforcement, S3 OAI integration |

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**  

### **1. DynamoDB Table Setup**  
Let create a highly available database table for user data storage.  
1. Navigate to **DynamoDB Console** ‚Üí **Create Table**  
2. Configure with:  
   - **Table name**: `PskTable`  
   - **Partition key**: `studentid` (as a **String**)
   - Leave default settings for other configuration.
   - After Deployment, click on **PskTable** and click on **explore table items** to view every item we created or added. Initially it will be empty table as we known.

### **2. Lambda Functions Deployment**  
We gonna deploy serverless functions for data processing with Python language but don't worry I already provided the code just for **You**.  
  
1. **Create Function**:  
   - Name: `GetPsk` | Runtime: **Python 3.13** | Architecture: **x86_64**  
   - Permissions: **Create new IAM role** from basic Lambda template

2. **Add Inline Policy**:  
   - Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Select `GetPsk-role-XXXX`  
   - Create inline policy with:
!1
!2  
   - Click **Deploy**
   - Create new test event and click on **Test**, you answer should be like my output.
   - It means there is no data inside the table.

3. **PostPsk Function Setup**  
Repeat with these changes:  
- Name: `PostPsk` | Runtime: **Python 3.13** | Architecture: **x86_64**  
   - Permissions: **Create new IAM role** from basic Lambda template

2. **Add Inline Policy**:  
   - Go to IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Select `PostPsk-role-XXXX`
!5
   - Create inline policy with:
   - Click **Deploy**
   - Create new test event and named it and add simple item and save it.
!6
   - click on **Test**, you answer should be like my output.
   - Now, the output only show completion but you can view within DynamoDB **explore table items**.

### **3. API Gateway Configuration**  
The next step is to create secure API endpoints with CORS support.  
1. Create **REST API** (Edge-optimized) named `DataAPI`  
2. Under `/data` resource , click on **create method**,  
   - Choose method type as `GET` ‚Üí choose the function named `XXX:GetPsk`and **create method**.
!8 
   - Choose method type as `GET` ‚Üí choose the function named `XXX:PostPsk` and **create method**.

3. **Enable CORS**
   - Click on **enable CORS**.
!9
   - Check the **GET** and **POST**.
!10
   - May be you notice there is an **Option** method appear between two method.
   - Finally click on **Deploy API** and pick **new stage** and name something and deploy it.

### **4. Frontend Hosting (S3)**  
**Objective**: Deploy static website with secure access controls.  
1. Create S3 bucket: `your-app-frontend`  
2. Enable **Static Website Hosting** in properties  
3. Upload:  
   - `index.html`  
   - JavaScript files (with updated API endpoint)  
4. Apply bucket policy restricting access to CloudFront only  

---

### **5. CloudFront Distribution**  
**Objective**: Enable HTTPS and global content delivery.  
1. Create distribution with S3 as origin  
2. Critical settings:  
   - **Origin Access Identity (OAI)**: Create new  
   - **Viewer Protocol Policy**: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS  
   - **Default Root Object**: `index.html`  
3. Wait 15-20 minutes for global deployment
